# QR-Code-Generator
 This project converts a .txt file to a qr code and saves the code as a png
 
 To Start:
  1. Create a folder called "codes", this is where the qr-codes will be stored

For now, the larger the amount of text the more fine tuned the png code will be - leading to it being harder to read
